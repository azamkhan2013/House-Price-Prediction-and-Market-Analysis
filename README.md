Project: Assume you're a data analyst at a real estate agency that's interested in leveraging machine learning to better comprehend the housing market. Each group, using myfontR, is to scrutinize the dataset "house-data.csv" from classification, prediction, and validation perspectives. Your statistical analysis should be conducted using the R programming language, and you should include the R code as part of your report's appendix. This code should be executable without errors. When responding to the tasks, be sure to explain your methods and provide justification for your answers. Additionally, you are required to discuss your discoveries for each task.

Initial task involves numerical and graphical summarization of the data set, and any relevant comments or observations.

Houses are to be categorized based on their overall condition (OverallCond) as follows: • Label as 'Poor' if the overall condition ranges from 1 to 3. • Deem 'Average' if the overall condition falls between 4 and 6. • Consider 'Good' if the overall condition is between 7 and 10. 

(a) Establish a logistic regression model to predict the overall condition (OverallCond) of a house. 

(b) Implement a separate classification method known to categorize the house condition and carry out a similar study.

For house price prediction: 

(a) Utilize two methods to forecast house prices. Rationalize your model selection and discuss the results you acquired. 

(b) Choose two re-sampling techniques to approximate the test error associated with applying these selected methods from 3(a) on a set of observations. Comment on the results you discovered.

Lastly, propose what other aspects might be intriguing to investigate using the "house-data.csv" dataset. Identify a 'research question' related to housing data and apply methodologies at our disposal to address this question.
